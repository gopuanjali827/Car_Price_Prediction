CAR PRICE PREDICTION
📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, horsepower, fuel type, and more.

Car price prediction is a popular use case in data science as it helps buyers and sellers understand the fair market value of a vehicle.
