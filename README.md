# Car_Price_Prediction
The price of a car depends on many factors like its brand reputation, mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type, horsepower, engine capacity, and additional features. Estimating the correct price is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automobile market.
📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, horsepower, fuel type, and more.

Car price prediction is a popular use case in data science as it helps buyers and sellers understand the fair market value of a vehicle.
